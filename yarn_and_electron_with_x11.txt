Title: How to Start Electron GUI App from VS Code Remote Terminal?

I'm using [electron-react-boilerplate][1] to start learning GUI app development. I'm doing remote development into an Ubuntu VM using VS Code's Remote extensions, so my goal is to run `yarn` commands all within the Integrated Terminal.

Running `yarn` in the Integrated Terminal works fine to install dependencies. However, running `yarn dev` doesn't work. It only works if I go over to my GUI client window for my VM, spawn up a Terminal window, `cd` into the project, and run `yarn dev`, which will then start the GUI app. What I'd like to be able to do instead is run `yarn dev` from VS Code's Integrated Terminal and have the Electron GUI app start over in my VirtualBox GUI client. That way, I can see any `yarn dev` logs right in VS Code's Integrated Terminal.

I'm imagining I'd have to do something with X11 to get this to work, but I don't know what. I'm gonna read the docs. How can a VS Code Integrated Terminal start GUI apps over in a VirtualBox GUI window?

For reference, this is the `yarn dev` setting in electron-react-boilerplate's `package.json`:

```json
"dev": "cross-env START_HOT=1 node -r @babel/register ./internals/scripts/CheckPortInUse.js && cross-env START_HOT=1 yarn start-renderer-dev"
```

Answer:

In `package.json`, change `dev` to:

```json
"dev": "cross-env START_HOT=1 node -r @babel/register ./internals/scripts/CheckPortInUse.js && cross-env START_HOT=1 DISPLAY=:1 yarn start-renderer-dev"
```
